# gulp-starter
Some basic gulp tasks for development and production

- Pull the repo
- install gulp globally, run `npm install -g gulp`
- run npm install
- For development, run the `gulp` command
  - This will start the watch tasks for SCSS and JavaScript
- For production, run the `gulp prd` command
  - This will not run the watch tasks, but will minify CSS and JavaScript and add vendor prefixes for relative CSS3 properties
